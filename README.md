## Programs

### 1. Arithmetic Operations

This program assigns two numbers to variables `a` and `b`, performs arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), and prints the results.

- **Input:** None (numbers are hardcoded)
- **Output:** The result of arithmetic operations


### 2. Odd or Even

This program takes a number as input and checks whether the number is odd or even.

- **Input:** A number
- **Output:** Whether the number is odd or even


### 3. Grade Categorizer

This program takes a score (0-100) as input and categorizes it into grades (A, B, C, D, F).

- **Input:** A score between 0 and 100
- **Output:** The corresponding grade


### 4. Basic Calculator

This program takes two numbers and an arithmetic operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) as input, performs the operation, and prints the result.

- **Input:** Two numbers and an operation
- **Output:** The result of the operation


### 5. Age Categorizer

This program asks the user for their age and categorizes them as either a minor (under 18), an adult (18-65), or a senior (over 65).

- **Input:** Age
- **Output:** Age category


### 6. Password Checker

This program asks the user for a password and checks if it matches the predefined password (`python123`). It grants or denies access based on the match.

- **Input:** A password
- **Output:** "Access granted" or "Access denied"


### 7. Triangle Type Checker

This program takes the lengths of three sides of a triangle and determines if the triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.

- **Input:** Three side lengths
- **Output:** Type of triangle


### 8. Day of the Week

This program takes a number (1-7) as input and prints the corresponding day of the week. If the number is outside the range 1-7, it prints "Invalid input."

- **Input:** A number between 1 and 7
- **Output:** The corresponding day of the week or "Invalid input"


## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
